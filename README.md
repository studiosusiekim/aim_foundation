Aim Foundation is an automated marketing campaign web application for influencers.

'Helping others benefits those in need but can be deeply rewarding to you too. Supporting a cause you believe in has a positive effect on your own life. The knowledge that you’re serving a good cause is hugely empowering and, in turn, can make you feel happier and more fulfilled. 

Aim Foundation makes it easy to find a campaign that’s working for causes important to you; wether you want to make a donation or find out how to donate your time or be of help in any way. We offer an overview of world-wide campaigns that can change your life and those of others for the better'
